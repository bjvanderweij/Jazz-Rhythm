% Downbeat, Downbeat > Downbeat, Upbeat > Upbeat, Upbeat. Combination should use this hierarchy but doesn't really.
% However in combination with the top-down likelihood function it may.
% Expression
% Tempo curves are not relevant anymore. A subdivision approach may be a good way of researching expression in rhythm
% Cognitive plausibility
%	Incremental parsing
%	The bottom-up/top-down estimation of onset times doesn't seem to be very cognitively plausible.
% Other time signatures were not allowed, but theoretically it should be trivial to extend the present method for more time signatures.
% Swing ratio
