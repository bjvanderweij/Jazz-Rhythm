\abstract{%

An approach is presented here that estimates rhythmic structure of monophonic music performances based on onset times. This rhythmic structure is represented as subdivision trees. A chart parsing algorithm that uses probabilistic beam search is presented to construct these structures. The probabilistic model is split up in a rhythm model that estimates the probability of rhythmic structures a priori and an expression model, that estimates the probability that a particular structure generated the observed performance. The expression model is constructed in a way that it can potentially account for expressive notions as emphasising downbeats, however parser performance was not found to improve using this expression model. Furthermore, an annotated corpus containing monophonic performances of well-known jazz standards is presented here and used to evaluate the parser.
