An approach is presented here that interprets rhythmic structure of monophonic music performances based on onset times. Rhythmic structure is represented as a subdivision tree. A chart parsing algorithm that uses probabilistic beam search is presented to construct these structures. The probabilistic model is a Bayesian model that is split up in a rhythm model, which estimates the probability of rhythmic structures a priori and an expression model, which estimates the probability that a particular structure generated the observed performance. The expression model is constructed in a way that it can potentially capture consistent local expressive timing such as stretching certain beats to emphasise them. However, parser performance was not found to improve using the expression model. Furthermore, a new annotated corpus containing monophonic performances of well-known jazz standards is presented here and used to evaluate the parser.
