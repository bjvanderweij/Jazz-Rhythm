\section{Introduction}

Thesis:
\begin{itemize}
\item Many models use a prior proportional to score complexity, we use a more advanced notion of score likelihood
\item Many models use a likelihood where expressive timing is additive noise. We think there is a correlation between structure (down- and upbeats) and expressive timing
\item Some models use tempo curves to compensate errors introduced by tempo changes, we don't need tempo curves, do we?
\item A structural analysis is more powerful (and simpler?) than Temperley's common practice rhythm models
\end{itemize}

% Analysis of rhythms. Not interested in audio recordings, purely interested in structure behind rhythm
