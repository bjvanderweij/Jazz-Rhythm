% Figures to generate:
% Likely and unlikely interpretations of a rhythm
% Examples of how combination and subdivision analysis works
% Example of ambiguity
% Example of too fine-grained analysis and too coarse
% Example of tree translated to notes at different levels
% Example of swung notes
% Phase shifted rhythm for illustrating importance of prior
% Syncopation to illustrate prior, perhaps using Temperley's examples
