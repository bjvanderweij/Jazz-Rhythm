Mission critical:

  Annotation
* Add support for saving triplets lossless
* Ability to add bars in annotations (all the things you are 27-1 needs this) (length bug)
* Annotate

  Models
* Implement Temperley's hierarchical model

  Dissertation
* Read Temperley 2009 completely
* Start writing report

Other

* Switch modes with up while in INSERT mode
* Split annotation in themes, get rid of long silences
* Implement <line>G to go to a cursor position, note or annotation
* Implement jazzr.annotation.tool.strip()
* Implement jazzr.annotation.tool.subtract()
  * Implement support for cutting out parts of midi files
* Implement function that generates a midifile from an annotation
* Add docstrings to all modules, classes and functions
* Loading saving annotations properly. Midifiles should be represented as an abstraction in the annotator
* Calculate local bpm (per measure/per beat)

Questions

* How to represent bound notes
* How to represent notelengths (rests/explicit notelengths)
* Is a representation of numbers + beatspb + beatdivision good enough?
* Base annotation on what performance or on score? 
  (Notes that are played in error? 
  Notes that are clearly played on a different metrical position?
  Grace notes?)
