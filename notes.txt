Forms of expression and deviation from score:

1. Playing notes on the offbeat before the strong beat (usually a one). Explicitly annotated.
2. Playing a group of four quarter notes in 4/4 in the following fashion: first on the beat, second delayed about one 8th a note, third delayed about one 16th note
   fourth one played clearly on the fourth beat. The first beat of the next bar may be played as in 1. Not sure how to annotate.
   OCCURS IN:
    All the things you are (Annotated as triplet starting on beat 1.5)
3. Transforming 3 8th notes into a triplet. Explicitly annotated.
4. Transforming one 2 quarter notes into a note on the offbeat before the beat and another one about 16th beat after. Explicitly annotated
5. Grace notes, explicitly annotated as an extra note on the same beat. 
6. Quarter notes in ballads are interpreted very freely. Explicitly annotated.
7. Group of 2 eight notes starting at beat 4 and one note starting at beat 1 of the next measure. The eight notes are played delayed and faster. 
  Not sure how to annotate
  OCCURS IN:
    Black orpheus 5-3
8. Expression is context sensitive
9. Half note at beat 3 is played slightly delayed. Not sure how to annotate
  OCCURS IN:
    Brazil 10-8, 10-9, 12-8, 
10. Eight notes played in triplets. Annotation follows score.
  OCCURS IN:
    Don't get around much anymore 20-10
11. Expression has a remarkable similarity over different versions:
  E.G.
    Don't get around much anymore 20-10 bar 5 (score)
    and
    Don't get around much anymore 26-6 bar 5 (score)
    played rubato first time, as notated second time
